## Schnuppertag
### Aufgabe 3 has both 3 and 4

A challenging project where I had to work with Frameworks which I never knew before and even had to work with docker. 


## Requirements
- WSL 
- Docker Desktop
- Composer
- Laravel

## Concept
- User not logged in can see the all the index view but only limited.
- To do more user must be logged in
- But the guest index view gives possibility to log in
- Logged In users most of the features available
- First 3 users who are registered will be set as Admin
- Admin can do everything but users cannot delete or force delete
- And the rest of the users will be set by default user

- Job is dependent in Company and Category
- During the creation of Job Company and Category must be selected from the drop down list
- But From Job creation form Company and Category Creation is also possible
- But without company Job cannot exist so if company is deleted Job must be Deleted
- Category can be deleted and job will have unspecifed category as default
